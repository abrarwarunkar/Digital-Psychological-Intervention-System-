    "content": "Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. This is because when you breathe deeply, it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax. The brain then sends this message to your body.\n\nBox Breathing (4-4-4-4 technique): Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat 4-5 times. This technique is used by Navy SEALs to stay calm under pressure.\n\n4-7-8 Breathing: Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale completely through your mouth for 8 seconds. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, helping you relax.\n\nDiaphragmatic Breathing: Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your belly (not your chest) to rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth. This helps you breathe more efficiently and promotes relaxation.\n\nBenefits include: reduced stress and anxiety, lower blood pressure, improved  concentration, better sleep quality, and increased energy levels. Practice these exercises daily, even when you're not stressed, so they become second nature when you need them most.",
